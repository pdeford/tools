###pubmed_PMC_querier
[pubmed_PMC_querier](https://github.com/pdeford/tools/blob/master/pubmed_PMC_querier.py) is a tool that lets you query NCBI's PubMed database, take the resulting PMIDs, converts them to PMCIDs, and uses those to download the full text for all of the articles whose text is freely available. It also downloads the front matter (title, abstract, authors, etc.) for all available articles.
